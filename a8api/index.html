    <h2><br>Questions:</h2>
    <p> 
        1. Describe the API you selected and what it does <br>
        This API provides high quality collection of "neko" (a Japanese term for "cat") images. It's a straightforward API designed to offer cute or interesting neko images. <br>
        <br>2. Cite the website where you found it
        <a href="https://docs.nekos.best/index.html"><br>Click here for the site source</a> <br>  
        <br>3. Describe the options/parameters you used for the API request. i.e., what info did you
        need to provide (in the query string) to the API to get your results? <br>
        No additional query string parameters were required to fetch a basic set of results. The request was made directly to the endpoint without appending any query parameters to customize the type of results returned by the API.
        <br><br>4. Give two applications where this API would be helpful.<br>
        Developers can integrate this API into social media and messaging apps for sharing neko images as thematic stickers or reactions. In gaming and forums, especially anime-themed ones, the API allows for customization of avatars and profiles with neko images for fans of anime culture and cute aesthetics.
